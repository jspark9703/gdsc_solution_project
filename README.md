The UN‚Äôs 17 sustainable development goals that we chose is reducing inequality.


## üêïpreview 


To improve web app accessibility for visually impaired people, we created a shopping guide dog for grocery shopping for the visually impaired.

We observed and analyzed how visually impaired people use smartphones and conducted the project in a direction to identify and improve the problems of other web shopping malls.

As a result, we realized that it is important to deliver key information by identifying the information that users are interested in,

and to textify the information so that it can be understood by the screen readers of iOS‚Äôs voiceover and Android‚Äôs Talkback.

Users can use voiceover and talkback to shop according to the flow of shopping with only sliding gestures and navigation with a simple UI configuration.

We also designed each screen to use guidance messages to help users recognize the functions, products, and number of reviews, and to simplify the information to reduce the user‚Äôs information burden.

We also designed a review summary function so that users can easily check the pros and cons of reviews without reading multiple reviews.
